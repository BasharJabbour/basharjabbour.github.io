Full-Stack Developer with breadth of know-how in web-development. I have worked on UI overhauls to building APIs and scripting automated uploads.

I have strong experience in JavaScript and some of the most popular web technologies (ReactJS, Knockout, Bootstrap, jQuery), and a variety of backend languages and frameworks (C#, .Net Core, Python, Django, Go), along with experience in other technologies (SQL, Mongo, Redis, AWS technologies). I have also worked as scrum master for variety of teams. 

Mathematics, Software Development and a Technology enthusiast, I am motivated by projects that use my research, analysis and technical skills to empower people or that solve problems in a sustainable fashion. I value environments that are collaborative and team-oriented, coupled with opportunities for continuous growth and learning. 

I love adding to my professional connections, reach out if you want to talk math, bridging the gap between technology and other fields (particularly humanities and education) or even sports.
